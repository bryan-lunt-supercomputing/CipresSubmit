This document explains the basics of installing submit.py, specifically, into a CIPRES environment.

See readme.pdf for detailed explanations of various config files.

= Setting up Python =
You probably don't have admin priveleges on remote resource systems. However, we will need to install some python libraries.
You can either use virtualenv to create a virtual python installation with your own modules installed in it, or you can do a complete installation.

== Setting up a complete Python ==
If you have python on your system, you can skip this step.


== Bootstraping local installations ==
If you have pip installed, skip to after the PIP step, regardless of other things installed.

User-local python scripts are usually stored in "~/.local"

=== Upgrading setuptools ===
If your setuptools has a "--user" command line option, you can skip this step.

Download ez_setup.py ( https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py )

>python ez_setup.py --user

=== Installing Pip ===
If your site has pip installed, skip this step.

With a newer easy_install You can do this:
>easy_install --user pip

If you had to install setuptools:
>~/.local/bin/easy_install --user pip

=== Installing virtualenv ===
If you have virtualenv installed, you can skip this step.

Now, if you have pip installed, and on the path (either your own, or a system provided one) you can do:

>pip install --user virtualenv
OR
>~/.local/bin/pip install --user virtualenv



== Creating a virtualenv ==
Begin this step once you have virtualenv installed.
You should probably create a virtual python installation for CipresSubmit.

If you have a modules based environment, load the latest python:
>module load python

Then, in any case:
>virtualenv /where/to/create/virtualenvironment
(OR >~/.local/bin/virtualenv /where/to/create/virtualenvironment )

This creates a file hierarchy that looks like a python installation:
/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/bin
/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/lib
/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/lib/site-packages

Now, install the required packages for CipresSubmit into that virtualenv:
/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/bin/pip install -r /scripts/CipresSubmit/requirements.txt

*****
NOTE: These virtual environments are self-contained. They do not reference anything from "~/.local",
so if you have multiple resources which share a home directory, but are somehow otherwise incompatible, you can re-do the bootstrapping steps for each resource.

NOTE: WHen you use the pip from a virtualenv, you should NOT use the "--user" option.


= Installing the program =

CipresSubmit is included in the CIPRES sdk repository at /scripts/CipresSubmit
To install via file-copy (instead of using the installer) simply copy the contents of the /scripts/CipresSubmit/src/* to someplace on your path, such as the CIPRES scripts directory:

== Installing via PIP (Preferred) ==
From the directory with "setup.py", run:
>pip install .

== Installing via copy/paste ==
Copy the contents of the "src" directory to some directory on your path.


= Setting up .rc files =

The Cipres SDK properties file used for building the SDK contains properties for an .rc file to be sourced when connecting to remote resources.

These files are specified, though, for example:
teragrid.gordon.rc=/project/ps-ngbt/home/cipres/.bash_profile

Edit this (or create a new) .rc file to:
*Load the python module if your environment is module based.
*prepend the python virtualenv to the path:
	export PATH=/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/bin:$PATH
