This document explains the basics of installing submit.py, specifically, into a CIPRES environment.

See readme.pdf for detailed explanations of various config files.

= Creating a virtualenv =
You should probably create a virtual python installation for CipresSubmit.

If you have a modules based environment, load the latest python:

>module load python

Then, in any case:
>virtualenv /where/to/create/virtualenvironment


This creates a file hierarchy that looks like a python installation:

/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/bin
/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/lib
/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/lib/site-packages


Now, install the required packages for CipresSubmit into that virtualenv:

/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/bin/pip install -r /scripts/CipresSubmit/requirements.txt

= Installing the program =

CipresSubmit is included in the CIPRES sdk at /scripts/CipresSubmit

To install via file-copy (instead of using the installer) simply copy the contents of the /scripts/CipresSubmit/src/* to the someplace on your path, such as the CIPRES scripts directory:


= Setting up .rc files =

The Cipres SDK properties file used for building the SDK contains properties for an .rc file to be sourced when connecting to remote resources.

These files are specified, though, for example:
teragrid.gordon.rc=/project/ps-ngbt/home/cipres/.bash_profile

Edit this (or create a new) .rc file to:
*Load the python module if your environment is module based.
*prepend the python virtualenv to the path:
	export PATH=/where/to/create/virtualenvironment/bin:$PATH
