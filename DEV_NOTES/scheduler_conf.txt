scheduler.conf is created in the job directory by the remote (w.r.t. "submit.py") submitting system on stage-in.
It is a Java-Style .properties <key,value> pair file.
It contains some properties that the submit system may use to make decisions about how many nodes to request, max walltime, etc.

It seems to contain the following properties:



KEY					ACCEPTABLE VALUES									COMMENTS
jobtype				MISSING (No key), "", "direct","mpi"				Are these all?
mpi_processes		MISSING, "", 1,2,3...								INT: Default to 1 if missing/empty
threads_per_process	MISSING, "", 1,2,3...								INT: Default to 1
nodes				MISSING, "", 1,2,3...								Default to 1
runhours			MISSING, "", [0.0, inf)								FLOAT: Default to queue max?
